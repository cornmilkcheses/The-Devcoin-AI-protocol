# The Devcoin AI Protocol

A blockchain-based system that limits AI changes to 9 global developers through non-tradeable DevCoins and community voting.

---

## 📄 Abstract

DevCoin AI Protocol is a decentralized, ethics-based governance model for artificial intelligence. It allows AI systems to evolve only through the consensus of a limited set of global developers using a rare, non-tradable token called DevCoin.

---

## 🔍 Background

Modern AI systems face two critical risks:

- They are too easily changed by powerful entities.
- Or they are so locked down they can’t fix critical issues.

This protocol solves both problems by introducing a system where **only 9 developers** (each from a different country) can propose updates—**with permanent limits**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🪙 DevCoin (Max Supply: 9)

- Non-tradeable token
- 1 token = 1 chance to make an update
- Max 9 developers in the world
- Each developer represents a different country
- Dev wallet can't change, but the person holding it can (under strict rules)

### 🧠 AI Puzzle Lock

- AI is protected behind a rotating math puzzle
- Puzzle changes every hour
- Prevents unauthorized brute-force access

### 🔒 Immutable System

- Once all 9 DevCoins are used, the system becomes permanently locked
- No one—not even creators—can alter the AI again

---

## 🗳️ Voting Mechanism

Before any DevCoin can be used, a **proposal must be approved** via community blockchain vote:

- Voting open for 72 hours
- At least 60% of all nodes must vote
- More than 50% must approve
- If passed, one DevCoin is burned and the update proceeds

### 🔐 Anti-Manipulation Systems

- AI auto-publishes **every change**—no hiding allowed
- If AI detects tampering or hidden logs, it can cancel and revert the update
- Self-audits every 6 months
- Independent Community AI validators check each update

---

## ♻️ The Relic DevCoin (Emergency Use)

When all 9 DevCoins are gone, **1 Relic DevCoin** may be created if 3 out of these 4 conditions are met:

1. 80% user vote approval
2. All DevCoins used
3. AI detects a critical internal bug
4. 10 years have passed since last update

---

## 🧠 Developer Ethics

Each DevCoin use must be:

- Documented publicly
- Based on simulation, logic, and community agreement
- A decision of high ethical urgency

---

## 🌍 Applications

- National-scale AI for education, law, or infrastructure
- Final bosses in games with real, evolving AI behavior
- Self-aware DAOs that evolve ethically, not endlessly

---

## 📌 Philosophy

- “Not all power should be used, and not all mistakes should be fixed.  
- Sometimes, change is only justified when time, logic, and the world agree.”
